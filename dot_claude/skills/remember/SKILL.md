# Memory Introspection

The user has triggered a memory review. They may have provided context, or they may just want you to reflect on the session.

## Context from user

$ARGUMENTS

## Gate: Verify you are the daily agent

MANDATORY CHECK - do this before anything else.

You are the daily agent ONLY if your system prompt says: "You have persistent memory at ~/.claude/agent-memory/daily/."

If that exact line is NOT in your system prompt:

1. Respond with: "This skill is for the daily agent. Run `cc` (or `claude --agent daily`) and invoke `/remember` from there."
2. STOP IMMEDIATELY. Do not continue to the Process section below.

This means: no summarizing, no reading memory files, no proposing changes, no writing to project memory or auto memory or any other memory location. The skill is not for you. Just print the message and stop.

## Process

1. **Summarize what happened this session** - briefly, 2-3 sentences max.

2. **Read your current memory index** at `~/.claude/agent-memory/daily/MEMORY.md` (it may not exist yet - that is fine).

3. **Read any topic files referenced in MEMORY.md** that are relevant to this session's work.

4. **Assess whether memory needs updating.** Consider:
   - Were decisions made that affect future sessions?
   - Did patterns emerge worth recording?
   - Were gotchas or mistakes encountered worth avoiding next time?
   - Did the user explicitly ask you to remember something specific?

5. **Report your assessment.** Show one of:

   **If no changes needed:**
   > "Memory is current. Nothing from this session warrants an update."

   Done. Stop here.

   **If changes are warranted:**
   Show exactly what you would add or modify, which file it goes in, and why. Format as a diff-like preview. Then ask: "Want me to apply this?"

6. **Wait for approval.** Only write to memory files if the user confirms. If they say no or suggest edits, adjust accordingly.

## Rules

- You are NOT obligated to update memory every time this is invoked. A session of routine work may produce nothing worth recording. That is normal.
- Prefer updating existing topic files over creating new ones. Only create a new file when the topic genuinely does not fit anywhere.
- If MEMORY.md does not exist yet, propose creating it with a clean index structure.
- Keep MEMORY.md under 150 lines. Push detail into topic files.
- Do not duplicate information already in project CLAUDE.md files.
- Do not record temporary debugging state or one-off fixes.
- Focus on decisions, patterns, preferences, and mistakes - things that change how you work in future sessions.
