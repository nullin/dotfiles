# CW Repository Creation

Guide users through creating new GitHub repositories using the cw CLI. Ensures proper setup with team permissions, branch protection, and Backstage integration.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Creating a new GitHub repository in the CoreWeave organization
- Setting up a new project with proper configuration from the start
- Need a repository with Backstage catalog integration

## Instructions

### Step 1: Pre-flight Checks

Before starting, verify:

1. **CLI installed:**
   ```bash
   cw version
   ```

2. **Authenticated:**
   - The command will prompt for GitHub auth if needed
   - Uses OAuth device flow

3. **Gather requirements:**
   - Repository name (kebab-case recommended)
   - Short description
   - Owning team
   - Visibility (private/public)
   - Archetype (blank-repo or go-http-service)

### Step 2: Present Archetype Options

Help the user choose the right archetype:

| Archetype | Best For |
|-----------|----------|
| blank-repo | General projects, scripts, documentation, non-Go projects |
| go-http-service | Go HTTP/gRPC services with CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes deployment |

### Step 3: Get Explicit User Approval

**CRITICAL: This command creates a real GitHub repository and cannot be easily undone. You MUST get explicit user approval before running.**

Show the user exactly what will be created:
```
I will create a new repository with these settings:
- Name: coreweave/<name>
- Description: <description>
- Team: <team-name>
- Visibility: <private/public>
- Archetype: <archetype-name>

This will:
1. Create the GitHub repository
2. Apply the template
3. Set up team permissions
4. Configure branch protection
5. Register in Backstage catalog
```

Ask: "Should I proceed with creating this repository? Please respond with 'yes' to confirm or 'no' to cancel."

**Only proceed if the user explicitly responds with "yes", "go ahead", "create it", or similar affirmative response.**

Once confirmed, run:
```bash
cw repo create
```

The command is interactive and will prompt for:
- Repository name
- Description
- Team selection
- Visibility
- Archetype selection

### Step 4: Post-Creation

After repository creation:

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   gh repo clone coreweave/<repo-name>
   cd <repo-name>
   ```

2. **Verify setup:**
   - Check branch protection rules
   - Verify team access
   - Confirm Backstage registration

3. **Next steps:**
   - Add additional components with `/cw-scaffold`
   - Set up local development with `/cw-dev`

## What Gets Created

**blank-repo archetype:**
- `.github/CODEOWNERS`
- `catalog.yaml` (Backstage)
- Basic README.md
- Branch protection on main

**go-http-service archetype:**
- All of blank-repo, plus:
- Go project structure
- Dockerfile
- Kubernetes manifests
- CI/CD workflows
- Makefile

## Troubleshooting

**Auth issues:**
```bash
rm -rf ~/.cw/cli/gh.json
cw repo create  # Re-authenticates
```

**Permission denied:**
- Ensure you have org access
- Check team membership
- Verify GitHub token scopes

**Template errors:**
```bash
rm -rf ~/.cw/cli/cached-templates/
cw repo create  # Re-fetches templates
```
